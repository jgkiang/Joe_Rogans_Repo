Introduction and Problem:<br />
We are looking at the relationship between certain COVID data metrics and demographic metrics: <br />
COVID <br />
  *Vaccination Status <br />
  *Confirmed Case Totals <br />
  *Death Count Totals <br />
Demographic <br />
  *Age <br />
  *Race <br />  
  

Data Source: <br />
LA Times Archive of California Coronavirus Data

California Public Dept. of Health - Covid-19 Cases by Age Group (cdph-age.csv)<br />
California Public Dept. of Health - Covid-19 Cases by Race / Ethnicity (cdph-race-ethnicity.csv)<br />
California Public Dept. of Health - Covid-19 Vaccinations by Age Group (cdph-vaccination-state-by-age.csv)<br />
California Public Dept. of Health - Covid-19 Vaccinations by Race / Ethnicity (cdph-vaccination-state-by-race-ethnicity.csv)<br />


Research Questions:
1. What races have the highest vaccinations in California?
2. What age groups have the highest vaccinations?
3. What race has the highest positive test rate and death count?
4. Which age has the highest positive test rate and death count?


Limitations & Challenges:
1. When combining datasets, we have to take into account whether theyâ€™re pulling from the original raw dataset with access to the same amount of data.
2. Our data only covers California, therefore, any assumptions or recommendations we make may not apply to other states or countries. 
3. Due to time constraints, we did not use any datasets with current population counts, therefore we cannot make any per capita calculations.
